# MCP-Powered Voice Agent with DeepSeek

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive voice-enabled AI agent that integrates DeepSeek's language model with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for structured AI interactions. The system provides a complete voice processing pipeline built as an interactive Jupyter notebook environment for research and development of voice-based AI assistants.

The application demonstrates real-time audio processing, natural language understanding, and conversational AI capabilities through an intuitive interface that allows users to speak to an AI agent and receive intelligent voice responses.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
The system follows a linear pipeline architecture with the following data flow:
```
Voice Input → Speech Recognition → Text Processing → DeepSeek Model → MCP Protocol → Response Generation → Text-to-Speech → Voice Output
```

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime Environment**: Python 3.11 in Replit cloud platform with Nix package management
- **Development Platform**: Jupyter Notebook with interactive widgets for user interface
- **Audio Processing**: 
  - espeak-ng for text-to-speech synthesis
  - portaudio for low-level audio input/output operations
  - SpeechRecognition library for voice-to-text conversion
  - pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality
- **AI Processing**: 
  - DeepSeek language model for natural language understanding and generation
  - OpenAI API integration for additional AI capabilities
  - Transformers library for model loading and inference
- **Protocol Layer**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) for structured AI interactions
- **UI Framework**: Jupyter widgets (ipywidgets) for interactive controls and real-time feedback

### Deployment Architecture
- **Platform**: Replit cloud environment with containerized Python runtime
- **Port Configuration**: 
  - Primary Jupyter server on port 5000 (external port 80)
  - Secondary notebook server on port 8888
- **Access Control**: Open access with no authentication for development purposes
- **Process Management**: Parallel workflow execution using shell commands
- **Package Management**: UV lock file for dependency resolution and reproducible builds

## Key Components

### 1. Audio Processing Pipeline
**Purpose**: Handles the complete audio workflow from input capture to output playback

**Components**:
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts voice input to text using SpeechRecognition library with microphone access
- **Text-to-Speech**: Transforms AI responses back to audible speech using both espeak-ng and pyttsx3
- **Audio I/O Management**: Manages microphone input and speaker output through portaudio system
- **Real-time Processing**: Supports continuous audio stream processing for interactive conversations

**Architecture Decision**: Dual TTS approach (espeak-ng + pyttsx3) provides fallback options and cross-platform compatibility.

### 2. Language Model Integration
**Purpose**: Provides intelligent natural language processing and response generation

**Components**:
- **DeepSeek Model**: Primary language model for understanding user input and generating contextually appropriate responses
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation history and context across multiple interactions
- **Response Generation**: Produces human-like, contextually aware responses based on voice input
- **Model Loading**: Dynamic model loading and initialization with error handling

**Architecture Decision**: DeepSeek chosen for its advanced language capabilities and API accessibility, with OpenAI integration as backup.

### 3. MCP Protocol Integration
**Purpose**: Implements structured communication protocol for standardized AI interactions

**Components**:
- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensures compatibility with Model Context Protocol specifications
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation state and context between interactions
- **Structured Communication**: Provides standardized format for AI model interactions
- **Session Management**: Handles conversation sessions and context switching

**Architecture Decision**: MCP protocol adoption ensures interoperability and structured communication patterns.

### 4. Interactive Interface
**Purpose**: Provides user-friendly controls and real-time feedback for voice interactions

**Components**:
- **Jupyter Widgets**: Interactive UI components including buttons, progress bars, and status indicators
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual indicators for recording, processing, and playback states
- **Control Panel**: Start/stop recording, playback controls, and configuration options
- **Status Display**: System health monitoring and diagnostic information

**Architecture Decision**: Jupyter widgets chosen for rapid prototyping and seamless integration with notebook environment.

### 5. Development Environment
**Purpose**: Provides comprehensive development and testing platform

**Components**:
- **Multiple Notebook Files**: Separate notebooks for different functionality levels and documentation
- **Documentation Integration**: Extensive inline documentation and architecture explanations
- **Health Monitoring**: System diagnostics and performance tracking capabilities
- **Interactive Testing**: Built-in testing and validation features

## Data Flow

1. **Voice Input Capture**: User speaks into microphone, audio captured via portaudio
2. **Speech Recognition**: Audio converted to text using SpeechRecognition library
3. **Text Processing**: Input text preprocessed and formatted for AI model
4. **AI Processing**: DeepSeek model processes text and generates intelligent response
5. **MCP Protocol**: Response structured according to Model Context Protocol standards
6. **Context Management**: Conversation context updated and preserved
7. **Text-to-Speech**: AI response converted to audio using TTS engines
8. **Audio Output**: Generated speech played through speakers/headphones
